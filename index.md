I am a **Master's student** in political science at Freie Universität Berlin. Here is an overview of some projects I worked on, my major research interests, and some guiding practices for my work:

**Projects & Experience**
	- Researched in international political economy - especially capitalism and inequality - with a focus on development, extractivism, international financial institutions, and public opinion in African contexts
	- Contributed to initiatives aimed at reducing inequality in the German housing sector and supporting socially sustainable urban transformation
	- Worked on questions of technology, democracy, and digital governance — including algorithms, media systems, and political participation
**Research Interests**
	- Exploring the systemic effects of capitalism and investigating alternative societal and economic models
	- Advancing political agency and transformative change in response to contemporary global crises
**Guiding Practices**
	- Supporting a shift in collective consciousness necessary for sustainable and democratic transformation
	- Fostering compassion, belonging, and stronger collective identities
	- Experience in student leadership and self-organized media (e.g., editorial role at campus magazine FURIOS), with a focus on student needs, visibility, and community-building
